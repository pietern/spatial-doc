Application Overview
--------------------

Convolution is a common algorithm in linear algebra, machine learning,
statistics, and many other domains. This tutorial will focus specifically on
convolutions in 1 and 2 dimensions, but using techniques described in other sections
of this tutorial, it is up to the user to figure out how to write the algorithm
in any dimension.
